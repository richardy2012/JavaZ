===============================================

 - the main idea is to build a computation DSL


 - one of the (kind of higher level) goals of the library is to illustrate that
    - the monadic "bnd" method is, maybe, not abstract enough
      (I mean does not allow for enough implementation flexibility)
      to model concepts as exceptions and concurrency in the most natural way
    - the monoidal "and" method is abstract enough
      (I mean does allow for enough implementation flexibility)
      to model concepts as exceptions and concurrency in a more natural way

 - for the moment the following computation types
   are implemented
    - One
    - ZeroOrOne (aka Option)

 - in the near future the following computation types
   will be implemented
    - ZeroOrMore (aka Stream)
    - SuccessOrFailure (aka Try)
    - State
    - Future
    - ZeroOrMoreFuture
    - ConsoleIO
    - FutureIO
    - ...


Some vocabulary and statements used in comments
===============================================


[static] methods
----------------

 - a [static] method return value is obtained by,
   somehow, making use of its parameter values

 - a [static] method parameter value
   is called a method argument

 - a [static] method return value is obtained by,
   somehow, making use of its arguments


functions
---------

 - a function value,
   somehow, transforms an input value to an output value

 - a function value is called a function

 - a function is (when appropriate) also called a unary function

 - a unary function having a unary function output value
   is called a binary function

 - ...

 - a function,
   somehow, transforms an input value to an output value

 - an input value
   is called an input

 - an output value
   is called an output

 - a function, somehow, transforms an input to an output


producers
---------

 - a producer value,
   somehow, produces a value

 - a producer value is called a producer

 - a producer is (when appropriate) also called a nullary function

 - a producer,
   somehow, produces a value



consumers
---------

 - a consumer value,
   somehow, consumes a value

 - a consumer value is called a consumer

 - a consumer,
   somehow, consumes a value


computations
------------

 - a computation value,
   somehow, yields values

 - a computation value is called a computation

 - a computation,
   somehow, yields values

 - a values yielded by a computation
   is called a value of the computation
